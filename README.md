## About The Project
When I was a gymnastics a few years ago, I always wanted a tech tree like civ v's or HOI4's but to track my athletes and motivate them. Now that I can program I've implemented it with my Lukas G.

## Built With
Rust as a language. Rocket with handlebars and sled as frameworks. Everything is served server side.
